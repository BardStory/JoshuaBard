        <h3>Welcome to My Blog</h3>
        <p class="date">April 29, 2025</p>
        <p>
          This is my very first blog post on my personal website! I've decided to start this blog as a way to track my progress, organize my thoughts, and share updates about the projects I'm working on.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main purpose is to document my development process, set goals, and reflect on the work I’m doing — including improvements to this website itself. It’s a space where I can jot down both technical changes and creative ideas.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of my first goals is to make this blog easier to maintain. Right now, posts are added directly in the HTML, but I’d like to explore options like storing entries in a JSON file or building a basic authenticator so I can manage new content more efficiently.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thanks for reading — more updates to come soon!
        </p>
